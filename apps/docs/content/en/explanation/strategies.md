## fast

- Minimal provider set
- Low latency
- Good for search-as-you-type

## reliable

- Allows deeper provider nesting
- Collects more evidence before returning
- Default for checkout and onboarding

## reliable-fast (planned)

- Runs a fast plan and a reliable plan in parallel
- Returns fast results immediately
- Revalidates in the background and upgrades later
