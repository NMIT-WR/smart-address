# AI-friendly docs

These docs are written so both humans and AI tools can answer questions quickly.

Principles we follow:

- Start with intent and expected outcome.
- Define inputs, outputs, and constraints explicitly.
- Provide copy-paste examples and minimal variants.
- Keep section titles stable and descriptive for retrieval.
- Separate tutorials, how-to, reference, and explanation (Diataxis).

If you change APIs or behavior, update the matching reference and add a short note in the explanation section.
